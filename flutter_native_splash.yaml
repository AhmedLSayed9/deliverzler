flutter_native_splash:
  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.
  color: "#FAFAFA"
  color_dark: "#303030"
  # background_image: assets/native_splash/background.png
  # background_image_dark: assets/native_splash/background_dark.png

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.
  # It must be a png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  # image: assets/native_splash/splash_icon.png
  # image_dark: assets/native_splash/splash_icon_dark.png

  # Android 12 handles the splash screen differently than previous versions.
  # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.
  # If this parameter is not specified, the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
  # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
  # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle 640 pixels in diameter.
  # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle 768 pixels in diameter.

  # To hide the notification bar, use the fullscreen parameter.  Has no effect in web since web
  # has no notification bar.  Defaults to false.
  # NOTE: Unlike Android, iOS will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads.
  #       To show the notification bar, add the following code to your Flutter app:
  #       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  #       SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays([SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top]);
  fullscreen: true
